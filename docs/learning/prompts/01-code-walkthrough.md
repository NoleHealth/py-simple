# Learning Prompt 1: Code Walkthrough and Understanding

## Objective
Understand how the `py_simple/main.py` script works by analyzing it step-by-step and documenting your findings.

## Your Task
Review the script `py_simple/main.py` and explain how it works step by step. Create a comprehensive walkthrough that demonstrates your understanding of:

1. **Import statements** - What libraries are being used and why?
2. **Function structure** - How is the code organized into functions?
3. **Data flow** - How does data move through the application?
4. **Error handling** - Where and how are errors handled?
5. **Side effects** - What external systems does the code interact with?

## Prompt to Use with AI Assistant

```
Review the script py_simple/main.py. Create a step-by-step walkthrough document that explains:

1. What each import statement brings into the script and why it's needed
2. The purpose of each function and what it does
3. How data flows from the API call through processing to file output
4. What external systems the script interacts with (files, network, environment)
5. How errors are handled throughout the process
6. What side effects the script has (files created, network calls, etc.)

Please create the walkthrough in a new file:
docs/learning/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)-code-walkthrough-analysis.md

Format the document with:
- Clear section headers for each function
- Code snippets with explanations
- A data flow diagram (ASCII art is fine)
- A list of all side effects and dependencies
- Questions for further exploration
```

## Key Learning Points
After completing this exercise, you should understand:
- How Python modules are imported and organized
- Function decomposition and single responsibility principle
- Data processing pipelines
- External dependencies and side effects
- Basic error handling patterns
- Configuration through environment variables

## Follow-up Questions
1. What would happen if the API was unreachable?
2. What files does this script create and where?
3. Which parts of the code could cause the program to crash?
4. What environment variables control the script's behavior?
5. How would you test each function individually?

## Next Steps
Once you complete this walkthrough, you'll be ready to explore refactoring techniques in prompt #2.
