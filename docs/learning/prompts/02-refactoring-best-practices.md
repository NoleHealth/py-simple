# Learning Prompt 2: Refactoring for Best Practices

## Objective
Learn how to identify areas for improvement in existing code and apply refactoring techniques following Python best practices.

## Prerequisites
Complete prompt #1 (Code Walkthrough) to understand the current codebase structure.

## Your Task
Analyze the current codebase and identify opportunities for refactoring to align with Python best practices. Focus on code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

## Prompt to Use with AI Assistant

```
Review the py_simple codebase (main.py and config.py) and analyze it for refactoring opportunities. Create a comprehensive refactoring analysis that addresses:

1. **Code Structure & Organization**
   - Are functions doing too much (Single Responsibility Principle)?
   - Could any functions be broken down further?
   - Is the code organized in a logical way?

2. **Error Handling & Validation**
   - Are there missing error cases not being handled?
   - Should input validation be added?
   - Are error messages helpful for debugging?

3. **Type Safety & Documentation**
   - Where could type hints be improved?
   - Are docstrings comprehensive and helpful?
   - Could the code be more self-documenting?

4. **Performance & Efficiency**
   - Are there any performance bottlenecks?
   - Could memory usage be optimized?
   - Are there unnecessary computations?

5. **Testability & Maintainability**
   - How easy would it be to unit test each function?
   - Are dependencies properly injected?
   - Could configuration be made more flexible?

Create your analysis in:
docs/learning/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)-refactoring-analysis.md

Include:
- Specific code examples of current issues
- Proposed improvements with before/after code
- Priority ranking of improvements (High/Medium/Low)
- Explanation of the principles behind each suggested change
- Estimated impact of each refactoring on code quality
```

## Key Learning Points
After completing this exercise, you should understand:
- SOLID principles in Python
- Code smell identification
- Refactoring techniques and when to apply them
- The balance between over-engineering and maintainability
- How to write more testable code
- Best practices for Python code organization

## Areas to Focus On
1. **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each function should do one thing well
2. **Dependency Injection** - Reduce tight coupling between components
3. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive and user-friendly error management
4. **Type Safety** - Proper type hints for better IDE support and debugging
5. **Configuration** - Flexible and extensible configuration management
6. **Logging** - Structured and configurable logging throughout the application

## Follow-up Questions
1. Which function in main.py has the most responsibilities?
2. How would you make the API fetching more robust?
3. What would make the configuration system more flexible?
4. How could the data processing be made more extensible?
5. What dependencies are tightly coupled that could be loosened?

## Next Steps
After identifying refactoring opportunities, you'll learn how to add command-line parameters in prompt #3.
