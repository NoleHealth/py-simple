## Key Learning Points
After completing this exercise, you should understand:
- The testing pyramid and different types of tests
- How to write effective unit tests with proper isolation
- Mocking strategies for external dependencies
- Integration testing approaches and challenges
- Test automation and CI/CD integration
- Test-driven development (TDD) principles
- Code coverage metrics and their limitations

## Testing Pyramid for py-simple

### 1. Unit Tests (Base of Pyramid - Most Tests)
- **Function Testing**: Test each function in isolation
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies (requests, file system)
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Fast Execution**: Quick feedback during development

### 2. Integration Tests (Middle Layer)
- **Component Integration**: Test how functions work together
- **External Dependencies**: Test with real but controlled dependencies
- **Configuration**: Test environment variable handling
- **Data Flow**: Test complete data processing pipeline

### 3. End-to-End Tests (Top of Pyramid - Fewest Tests)
- **Full Application**: Test complete script execution
- **Real Environment**: Test in production-like conditions
- **User Scenarios**: Test actual usage patterns
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Verify business requirements

## Testing Approaches to Implement

### 1. Mock-Heavy Unit Testing
```python
@patch('requests.get')
@patch('pathlib.Path.mkdir')
@patch('builtins.open')
def test_complete_pipeline(mock_open, mock_mkdir, mock_get):
    # Test complete function with all dependencies mocked
    pass
```

### 2. Integration Testing with Real I/O
```python
def test_file_operations_integration(tmp_path):
    # Use temporary directory for real file operations
    config = Config()
    config.data_folder = str(tmp_path)
    # Test actual file creation and content
```

### 3. Property-Based Testing
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.lists(st.dictionaries(
    keys=st.text(),
    values=st.one_of(st.integers(), st.text())
)))
def test_process_data_properties(input_data):
    # Test properties that should always be true
    result = process_data(input_data, mock_logger)
    assert result['total_items'] == len(input_data)
```

## Essential Test Categories to Implement

### 1. Happy Path Tests
- **Valid API Response**: Test with typical JSONPlaceholder data
- **Configuration Loading**: Test with valid environment variables
- **File Operations**: Test successful file creation and writing
- **Data Processing**: Test typical data transformation

### 2. Error Handling Tests
- **Network Failures**: Test API timeout, connection errors
- **Invalid Data**: Test malformed JSON, missing fields
- **File System Errors**: Test permissions, disk space, path issues
- **Configuration Errors**: Test missing/invalid environment variables

### 3. Edge Case Tests
- **Empty Data**: Test with empty API responses
- **Large Data**: Test with large datasets (memory, performance)
- **Special Characters**: Test Unicode, special characters in data
- **Boundary Values**: Test limits and boundary conditions

### 4. Performance Tests
- **Execution Time**: Ensure processing completes within reasonable time
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption with large datasets
- **Concurrency**: Test behavior under concurrent execution
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup of resources

## Test Organization Best Practices

### 1. File Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_config.py
│   ├── test_data_processing.py
│   ├── test_file_operations.py
│   └── test_api_client.py
├── integration/
│   ├── test_pipeline_integration.py
│   └── test_config_integration.py
├── fixtures/
│   ├── sample_api_data.json
│   └── test_config.env
└── conftest.py  # Shared fixtures and configuration
```

### 2. Test Naming Conventions
```python
def test_process_data_with_valid_input_returns_expected_structure():
    """Test that process_data returns correct structure with valid input."""
    pass

def test_fetch_api_data_with_timeout_raises_requests_exception():
    """Test that API timeout raises RequestException with helpful message."""
    pass
```

### 3. Fixture Management
```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_api_data():
    """Provide sample API data for testing."""
    return [
        {"userId": 1, "id": 1, "title": "Test", "body": "Content"},
        {"userId": 2, "id": 2, "title": "Test 2", "body": "Content 2"}
    ]

@pytest.fixture
def temp_config(tmp_path):
    """Provide a temporary configuration for testing."""
    config = Config()
    config.data_folder = str(tmp_path)
    return config
```

## Coverage and Quality Metrics

### 1. Code Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: Aim for 90%+ line coverage
- **Branch Coverage**: Ensure all conditional paths are tested
- **Function Coverage**: Test all public functions
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% coverage for error handling

### 2. Quality Gates
- **Minimum Coverage**: Fail builds below threshold
- **No Flaky Tests**: Tests must be deterministic
- **Performance Bounds**: Tests must complete within time limits
- **Documentation**: All test functions must have docstrings

## Follow-up Questions
1. What's the difference between mocking and stubbing?
2. How would you test the script's behavior when the API returns partial data?
3. What strategies would you use to test the file writing functionality?
4. How would you test that the logging is working correctly?
5. What would you test to ensure the script handles rate limiting properly?

## Advanced Testing Challenges
1. **Testing Randomness**: How to test code with random behavior
2. **Testing Time-Dependent Code**: Handling timestamps and dates
3. **Testing External APIs**: Strategies for third-party service testing
4. **Testing Retry Logic**: Ensuring proper retry behavior
5. **Testing Resource Exhaustion**: Memory, disk space, network limits
